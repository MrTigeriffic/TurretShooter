TurretShooter

A turret shooter with gyro controls deveolped in Unity for the android platfrom.

The game is an in infinite shooter with random spawning enemies while you are in a turret using a phone gyro scope to control/aim.

This is a personal project that I have wanted to develop for a long time. One to learn and increase my knowledge of C# and gameplay mechanics.
Also to to get some nice shaders (when applicable) implemented into the game.
